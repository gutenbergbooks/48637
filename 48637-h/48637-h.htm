<p class="drop-cap">IN presenting this little book to the
public, the author would not dare to
claim perfection, for to err is human,
but we have sought to give the conditions
as they existed in this country in early days, and
we have not sought to display style or learning,
but we have sought to give the little book the
same tone and as near in the same language that
we used in early days as prudence will allow,
and we will leave the reader to judge of the merits
of the little book for himself; and we hope the good
people will pardon any errors they may find.
We hope you will be interested in the reading of
it, and if some thoughts are presented which will
prepare the readers the better for the battles of
life and for usefulness to others, then we are
well repaid for all our trouble.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE believe as the Author of this book
is so well known through this part of
the country it would hardly be necessary
to write much of an introduction; but by
being solicited by friends who had learned that
we were born and raised here in Illinois, we
consented to do so; Mr. Chalfant first spoke of it
then many others.</p>

<p>You will find the little book entirely original,
nothing borrowed, and what you find herein
that is good or bad, is our own production. The
book does not take sides in party politics or
church denominations, but the Author has given
some of his own thoughts on different questions.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN early days we had a great deal of hard
work to clear the land and then to make
and keep up the rail fences; and it took
four times the work to raise a corn crop as it does
now; and it took four times the work to cut the
firewood as it does now; and it took so much
work to prepare the material and make the clothing.
So the pioneers had to keep pretty busy;
and when the corn was in roasting-ear we had
to watch it pretty closely for the squirrels in the
day-time, and the coons in the night would
destroy a great deal of it, and later on if it was
not gathered early the deer and the turkeys and
prairie-chickens would eat it up.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN pioneer days after the corn was laid
by, as we called it, then we had a while
that we did not work much. There
was not much harvesting to do, as our
hay harvest was in the prairie grass, and that
was done late in August or September, and
during this idle spell the men would hunt and
fish, and those that did not have plenty of bees
would hunt “bee trees”, and get honey to do
them for the year.</p>

<p>The boys would go into the woods and dig
Ginseng; and when we would dry it we got
twenty-five cents per pound, and when we sold
it green we got ten cents per pound, and a boy
could make good wages for them times.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was Eighty Years Ago, in the wild
woods, on Mitchell’s Creek, near a good
spring, <span class="smcap">Jacob Perryman</span>, the father of
the author of this little book, pitched
his cabin. He was of Scotch descent, and my
<span class="smcap">Mother</span> was of German descent; they raised a
large family, of which we was the sixth.</p>

<p>The writer was born April 26th, 1836, and
raised there when it was almost impossible for a
boy to get an education; but he was supposed to
risk his chances with the wolf and the rattlesnake,
and all the dangers seen and unseen of
that early day. So you see the writer has lived
in Illinois more than three score and ten years,
and if, in speaking of my native State, we spread
the “paint” on pretty thick, you will pardon us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Maybe we have enjoyed life more than the most
of people have, and if the reader of this book
finds that the tone of it shows too much of a
disposition for mirth, remember it is our nature
and we cannot help it, and we attribute it to our
raising. The man who lives in Illinois and don’t
enjoy life is a man who does not know a good
thing when he has it. The man who lives in
Illinois and does not see beauties on every hand
to make him glad, is mentally cross-eyed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN traveling over the great fertile prairie
State of Illinois, and viewing its many
railroads, its many beautiful cities and
towns, its school houses, its churches,
its broad fields of waving grain, its orchards
bending under their load of golden fruit, its vast
population of industrious and intelligent citizens,
its mills, and its factories, one can hardly realize
that nearly all of this great improvement has
been made in the last sixty years, but such is
the case. Sixty years ago these prairies were an
unbroken howling wilderness, where the wolf
and deer roamed at will and raised their young
unmolested, and where the rattlesnake was in
his glory. The pioneer had unknowingly blazed
the way for what was to come; he did not seem
to know that these wild prairies was soon to
become the garden spot of the world.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">SIXTY years ago there was a law in
Illinois that all able-bodied men from
the age of 18 to 45 should meet and
drill as soldiers every alternate Saturday,
from the first Saturday in April till the
third Saturday in November. And they mustered
at my father’s every time. John L. Perryman,
my cousin, was Captain, a large, tall young man,
with a powerful voice; we could hear him give
the commands very plainly for two hundred
yards. He wore a stove-pipe hat, with his long
red plume stuck in his hat, and he looked nice
and I think he felt big. Ben. Tallman was
Orderly Sergeant. I think there was about one
hundred men in our precinct; and when Ben.
would call the roll, at nine o’clock, every man
would answer to his name. Uncle Philip Perryman
was fifer, and Harvey Cummings was
drummer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning pretty early the men would
begin to come in, and a good many women would
come to see the men muster, and some of them
would walk three or four miles.</p>

<p>We would listen for the delegation from the
West. The fife and drum and the Captain was
in that delegation; and when we would hear the
music and see that red plume coming around the
bend of the road, a boy would think his height
was ubout eight feet in his stockings and his
avoirdupois was about seven hundred pounds.</p>

<p>James Mitchell run a “still-house” near by
and when the men would go into ranks with two
or three “snorts” of Mitchell’s “best” they
would seem to forget but what they were in the
midst of the Revolutionary war, and each man
had patriotism and whiskey enough in him for
a half-dozen men, but when the whiskey would
die in him the patriotism would die too, but the
man would live by a small majority.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the early days, when a field was ready
to plant in corn, all the boys and girls
of the neighborhood would gather there
and some would drop the corn and some
would cover it with hoes; and sometimes a young
man and young woman would meet in the field
and stop and talk and sometimes make a bargain
to get married; and if it was very warm both
would be barefooted; and when they made an
engagement, that engagement was made to stay.
The divorce court got no work there; and when
they got married, all the people for miles around
would be there, and all would contribute something
to make up a big dinner of the best that
the country afforded. The men would get together
and cut logs and build them a house and
most every family for miles around would give
them a quilt or blanket, or pillow, and soon they
were pretty well fixed. Those people raised
boys and girls of large, strong brain, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of them boys are in Congress, or the Senate, and
some are on the Judges bench, and the girls
filling equally as honorable positions. For remember,
that our wisest and best statesmen
come from the field. Any land that will grow
corn will grow statesmen, and the statesmen
who grow up between the rows of corn will do
to depend upon anywhere.</p>

around him so thick that he had to climb a tree
to save himself, and he hollered with all his
might, but it was windy and no one heard him
until nearly morning. My Father heard him
and started to go to him, but Billy hollered and
told him not to come alone; then he went and
got John Hall to come with all his hounds, and
when they shot off their guns and the hounds
made a great noise, the wolves left, and Billy
came down almost chilled; and he said there was
between thirty and forty of the wolves. Such
was pioneer life in Illinois.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE HAD to work under some great
disadvantages; two of the greatest
was the want of money to do business
with, and the want of tools to work
with. The paper money was so uncertain, sometimes
a bill which was good to-day was worth
nothing to-morrow. It was not Government
money; some of it was State money, but sometimes
the State could not redeem its money. If
you sold a man a horse you would get from
twenty-five to forty dollars for him, and if you
got it in paper you must go to where they had a
“Detector”; a little paper that was issued every
two weeks, showing what the different money
was worth at the time the “Detector” was issued.
You would often get bills representing at least
one hundred dollars to get thirty dollars. This
bill is worth twenty-five cents to the dollar, and
this bill is on a bank which is a little better, it
is worth forty cents, and so on; and we got very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
small prices at best. We had almost no market.
Sometimes produce was hauled to St. Louis in
wagons and fat hogs were driven to the same
market. And the tools we had to farm with
were mostly home made, and now farmers would
not think of using such tools at all. We had
nothing like a harrow or roller, the clods must
be broke up with hoes, and the corn must be
hoed two or three times; and the wheat and oats
must be cut with reap hooks, and if a man would
reap one acre per day he was doing well. But
the people had what they was used to, and as
they did not expect anything better they worked
on pretty well contented.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS probably in 1831, there was a
little snow, and my Father was gone
from home, and when nearly dark, the
two big dogs smelled something down
about the back of the field, and they would bark
and growl and whine, and my Mother tried to
get them to go, but they was afraid to go. When
Father came home my Mother told him how the
dogs had acted, and as soon as it was light
enough to see, in the morning, my Father went
down there and came back, and said there had
been a large bear went between the fence and
the bank of the creek. He got two of his neighbors
to go with him, and they followed his track
about a mile and found where he had went into
a patch of thick hazels, and had broke down a
lot of the bushes with his teeth to lay on to keep
him out of the snow; but he ran out before they
got up close, and all the dogs after him, and
every little while he would stop to fight the dogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and when the men would come up, he would
run again, but finally, he was so large and fat
he tired out, and the men got up pretty close,
but they were afraid to shoot for fear they would
hit the dogs; but after awhile one of them got a
pretty good chance and shot him through behind
the shoulders, and when the blood began to run
and he began to sink, all the dogs piled on him,
and the men ran up and beat them off and cut
his throat. They did not weigh him, but they
thought he would weigh near three hundred
pounds.</p>

the wolves were killing my Father’s
pigs more than usual, and he went to
the men who kept hounds and got
them to come early in the morning, and they
brought about twenty-five dogs and they soon
started a wolf, and it circled a little, then started
north, and about fifteen men and twenty-five
dogs after it, and it went north nearly to the
knobs timber, then turned northwest to near
where Assumption now stands, and then turned
south to near to where Rosemond now stands,
and they caught it just south of Rosemond, and
about half of the men and all the dogs but eight
had dropped out when they caught it at sun-down;
and they said they run it about thirty-five
miles, then they had to go about twenty miles to
home, in the night; but two men went south to
hunt up the Sarver’s and Fraley’s to come with
fresh hounds and try for the other one, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
were there at daylight, and my Mother had got
breakfast for them, and I remember hearing
Uncle John Sarver say: “Boys, I can get on
old Nance and take my two oldest dogs “Sam
Houston” and “Davy Crockett” and I can catch
any wolf on the earth, but I want from sun-up
till sun-down to do it, for it takes a hard run for
thirty or thirty-five miles, but we’ll get him.”
My Father had found where their den was in a
mound on the prairie about a mile east of our
house; and they soon jumped the other wolf and
took nearly the same route as the one did the
day before, but when it got around the head of
Beck’s creek timber it turned south and they
caught it just at night in a lake just west of
where Oconee now stands. They had tied all
the dogs that had run the day before but John
Hall’s “old Rule”, a long-legged spotted dog,
that led the chase all day the day before, broke
his rope and went in the lead all that day. Now
the young wolves was a little larger than a rabbit.
The next morning all the men and all the dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in the settlement, and a number of women was
there, and during the day they caught seven
young wolves; they didn’t run very far; and
John Hall and John Sarver said they could take
“old Rule” and “Sam Houston” and they could
catch the Devil.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE sometimes hear men joke about the
proverbial “coon skin” of early days,
but it was no joke in our boyhood,
we had to have the Raccoon in our
business. If the coon crop had failed we would
have had a coon skin panic, which would have
swept all over the country. But the coon had
one bad habit, he liked roasting-ears a little too
well; but his diet in the spring and summer was
frogs and crawfish and bugs, and in the fall and
winter it was acorns and hackberries and corn.
And if a dog was not a coon dog he was no dog
at all; and an old experienced coon dog could
tell better when it was a good night for coons to
travel than a boy could; he would come to the
door and whine and howl, then the boys would
gather their ax and away into the woods, and
soon “old Pomp” was gone, then they would sit
down on a log and listen and after awhile away
up the branch “y-o-w”, “y-o-w”; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the boys would get there, whether the tree was
big or little it had to come down, or one of the
boys would climb up and scare his coonship out.
The coon was a bad fighter, and could whip a
dog very quickly, unless the dog understood how
to kill them; but when we saw a dog take a
“running shoot” at a coon and strike it with his
breast and knock it down, then grab it through
the ribs, and hold it to the ground very tightly,
we knew that dog was “onto his job”, for he
would kill it pretty quickly.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE writer of this little book was born
and raised in a log-cabin on Mitchell’s
creek, in Shelby county, Illinois,
twelve miles south-west of Shelbyville,
the county-seat. Date of birth, April 26,
1836. At that time there was a poor chance for
a boy to get an education; but we love to think
of those days, because nature in all her beauties
was so near like the hand of God had formed it;
the skill of man had changed it so little, and it
was our school and our delight to roam over the
wide unbroken prairies, where the lark was
singing in his native home. Where the wild
flowers, of all colors, were more beautiful than
Solomon in all his glory. These scenes inspired
a feeling in a boy’s heart of awe and reverence
for the God of nature more deep and sublime
and true, than all the preaching could inspire.
When a boy would get on a high piece of ground
and look around he saw a more beautiful sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
than he will ever see again on this earth, and
his eyes would fill with tears and from the depths
of his boyish heart he would give glory to God;

and then than he ever will be again, until God
shall call him home.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN early days, in Illinois, there was very
little distinction made between man’s
work and woman’s work; for the men
could cook and wash and spin, and
could do almost any kind of woman’s work, and
the women could do almost any kind of man’s
work. The girls could yoke up the cattle and
go and cut and haul a load of wood, and sometimes
when the girls were not in the field they
would go and shoot a mess of squirrels and make
a big pot-pie for their brother’s dinner. Where
there were large families, the parents did but
little, the boys and girls done nearly all; and
they looked forward to the time when the corn

for then all the boys and girls would be together
and have a good time; and in pulling flax they
would take a swath four feet wide and see who
could pull through first, and generally the girls
would beat the boys, for it was not heavy work,
but all depended on being quick.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NOTHING in the memory of the early
settler remains more vivid than the
chase. Fresh in our memory is our
boyhood days, when “hunting day”
would come, generally on Saturday unless that
was “muster day”. You may think that we
hunted most of the time, but that is a mistake.
We could not take the time, but one day in the
week was regular “hunting day”. All was stir
and bustle very early in the morning, the Father
and the two big boys would see that their guns
were well loaded and in good fix and bullets in
each pouch, and as soon as it was light enough
the long ox-horn was taken down and taken outside
the door, and then the excitement grew
more intense, for as soon as the long blast
“t-o-o-o-o-t” was given every hound would stand
on his hind feet and see which could holler the
loudest, and big, little, old and young would
come to the door to take part in the jubilee, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the baby would slap his little hands and holler,
for he knew there was something up. Then
away to the woods and little glades they would
go. Then we would stand out and listen with
almost breathless silence, but we didn’t have to
listen very long, for directly, hark! the long-drawn-out
“b-o-o” was heard. “Oh, they have
struck a cold trail, that is ‘old Pomp’” “Maybe
a coon.” But directly he would begin to warm
up on his subject, and “Muse” and “Joler”
would fall in, and directly, all at once, all would
turn loose, pups and all. “Oh! its a deer, they
have jumped it up.” Then they would fairly
make the woods ring for awhile; and when we
would hear the crack of the faithful rifle we
knew that meant fresh venison, for we knew that
to miss a shot was not their style.</p>

boy, and he had an odd, careless way
that made people laugh. Almost
every day Peter would do something
so odd, and so droll, and so unexpected, that he
kept up fun for the whole neighborhood; and he
didn’t seem to know or care what the people
said. But Peter was so honest and so industrious,
and so good-hearted, and so unpretending
that they all liked him. When Peter was nearly
grown, he worked for John Crocker all one summer
for a nice yoke of work cattle, and by the
time he had the cattle paid for winter was coming
on, he had fallen in love with a real good
girl by the name of Mima Brewer; and her folks
were wealthy, but Peter did not know that that
made any difference, and so he went to see Mima
and found that he was very welcome. Now he
goes to work to make a sled to take Mima sleigh-riding,
but before he got his sled done Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
came, and a good snow, and Mima wanted to go
to her Uncle’s, about four miles. Now Peter
had no horse or sleigh; now what was to be done?
Mima wanted to go and she must not be disappointed;
and Peter borrowed a one-horse sleigh
and went and yoked up his cattle, and got an
old pair of harness and put them on “Tom” the
near ox, and put him in the shafts, and “Jerry”
had nothing to do but walk along at the side,
and Peter and Mima got in the sleigh and they
went there and back in good order. Peter soon
got his sled done and he went and got license
and he and Mima got in the sled and went and
got married and went to work and soon they
were raising more horses, more cattle, sheep and
hogs than anybody around there, and soon they
had a good farm, good house and barn, and
next, they was riding in the finest carriage in
that country, and the people that laughed at
them when they took their first sleigh-ride had
to walk.</p>

apt to go several miles and circle in the woods
for several hours, but it would come back after
awhile and cross the road within ten feet of
where it crossed before, and now the thing to do
was to all go home and go to work, only, leave
the boy that was the surest shot and had the best
gun and the hounds would follow it, and that
boy would have almost a dead sure thing if he
would stay there, when it would get nearly to
the road it would stop to see if the coast was
clear, then the boy would shoot it through the
heart, then he would blow the signal for help on
the horn, then a boy was sent with a gentle horse
to help him fetch it home.</p>

then go away down in the valley and shake down
the wild plums for the hogs to eat; then carry
water and put it in the ash-hopper to make the
soap; then pick wool while he rests; then go and
see if the deer-skins are ready to be taken out of
the trough and rubbed dry; then help to put the
“chain” through the “harness” to make the
cloth; then go and look where is the best place
to cut prairie hay; then carry up some pumpkins
to dry. But the “pioneer boy” was a happy,
rollicking lad; he had just what he expected, and
he knew he was a good shot with the rifle, and
was handy with the ox-whip, and had a good
“coon dog”, and that was enough for him.</p>

But the people doubted whether the land would
ever be worth the money. Tom. Bell lived at
Bell’s Grove, West, and the Abbot’s and a few
others lived on the head of Beck’s Creek, East;
but the prairie where Pana stands there was
nothing to show that man had ever been there,
not a tree or shrub was there; but the deer and
wolves raised their young there, and the rattlesnake
had his own way; only when the prairie
burned over in warm weather, then thousands
of them burned to death. When the men were
first breaking up the prairie sod they would tell
of killing twenty to thirty rattlesnakes in one day.</p>

told him for him and the boys to fetch their guns

treed, and he told her to stay there and keep up
all the noise she could, and they run and shot
them, and they proved to be wildcats; John said

than three score and ten years, and
in that time we have seen great
changes. We have seen the change
from the ox-team to the steam engine; we have
seen the change from the wooden mold-board
plow to the steam plow; we have seen the change
from the reap-hook to the self-binder, and from
the lizzard to the automobile; from the bull-tongue
corn plow to the two-horse riding cultivator.
We have witnessed the change from the business
being carried on through the medium of trade
and traffic to the time when most men have
money in the bank. During the first half of our
seventy years, Illinois was yet in its infancy and
grew very slowly, but during the last half she
has developed very rapidly, and has made rapid
stride in the way of improvement, and other
great changes are to come yet, and they will
come pretty rapidly. The spirit of enterprise is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
on the wing and moving swiftly, and the outlook
is flattering. The people are learning; they are
laying down their party prejudice, and looking
at the situation more wisely. We have had an
era of extreme corruption, but that has nearly
had its day, for the voters see that their prejudice
is the only thing which made that corruption
possible. We think we can see reasons to believe
that the corruption and lawlessness will
have to go; and the drunkenness will have to go.
The few party leaders have kept the voters
blinded as long as they can, and when the people
get their eyes wide open they are mighty
and the law-breakers and corruptionists will
have to take a back seat.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN early days there was an empty cabin
in our neighborhood at one time, and a
man came along and wanted to teach
school, if he could get fifteen scholars
he would teach three months for one dollar and
fifty cents per scholar, and would take his pay
in corn, wheat, pork, beans, honey, beeswax, or
anything, and he boarded around among the
families who sent pupils. All right; and the
men went into the woods and cut some “linn”
(linden) trees and split them open and hewed
some of the worst splinters off the flat side and
bored holes and put legs in the round side and
made us some good benches; we took the oxen
and hauled up some wood and Mr. Anderson
set in to teach. He did not know much more
than a goat, but that made no difference. Brady
Phelps’ children would fetch their little, speckled,
bench-legged “fiste”, and he would stay in the
house, under their bench, and when we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
stick our feet back under the bench and touch
him he would bite us on the heel. Frank Perryman
was just about my age and just about as
mean; at the noon hour he and I would get a
wild grape-vine, and one take hold of either end
and get outside the door, then send a boy in to
run him out, and when he jumped to go over
the grape-vine we would fetch a yank and throw
that dog twenty feet high; when we had sent
him up a few times he quit the school of his own
free will and accord.</p>

Ben. Talman kept tavern on the East; Rand

E. A. Douthit was sheriff and collector. Joseph
Oliver was there, also the Trembles, Tacketts,
Cutler’s, and C. Woodard. John D. Bruster run

was the leading lawyer; Sam’l W. Moulton came
there when we were a boy. We remember hearing
Abraham Lincoln plead a divorce case in
the old court house sixty years ago. At that

horseback, and carried their books in their

the rattlesnake; while the other snakes would

very large, I have seen them at least four feet

they were easily seen; the prairie rattlesnake

I was a good runner, was barefooted, and I
headed him; then he took the road for William
Sullivan’s, and there was a race, he went straight
for the house. Mr. Sullivan had four daughters
and I was very bashful, and he also had two big
dogs of whom I was afraid, but I could not afford
to lose my steer; over the fence he went and I at

corner of the house from one way and the other
dog from the other way, and made at the steer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they had him between them; both doors of the
house were open, the women were engaged in
quilting and were not apprised of our arrival,
and the first they knew we went in at the door,
turned the table over on the cat, while as he
went in at the door I caught him by the tail and
as he went out at the other door, I fetched a
yank to the North, which he was not expecting,
thus throwing him flat against the wall, then he
bellowed as loud as he could; then the women
wanted to kill me and the steer too for scareing
them so bad; I was hot and scared too, but I tied
my steer to a tree, took off my hat, backed up
in the shade of a tree, made a long speech upon
the short-comings of steers and dogs, and that
boys were no better; they all listened and when
they got to laughing, we grew eloquent and used
big words and lots of them, while they got to
clapping their hands and laughing big and loud
I left them in fine humor.</p>

how the pioneers made the chimneys
to their cabins. They would build
up with split logs to the arch, and
rive out sticks about one and one-half inches
thick and two inches wide; they would make
mortar of clay and mix in some grass to hold it
together; they would make a scaffold and throw
the mortar on that scaffold, and one boy or man
would stand there and roll that stiff mud into
what was called “cats”; those “cats” were about
three inches thick and eight inches long. The
builder stayed up in the inside of the chimney,
they would pitch the “cats” and the sticks up
to him, he would put on a round of the “cats”,
then a round of the sticks, then pound the sticks
down with a hand maul so that the mud was
about one and one-half inches thick on both sides
of the sticks; and that was a safe chimney for
twenty years.</p>

to stay; then you must tell your name and where

have a great respect for the church,
not for any one particular denomination,
but for all who seek to serve
their Creator with all their heart, according to
their best understanding of His will. We was
raised under the teaching and influence of the
Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian and the Christian
churches. John Hall and others was preaching
the Methodist doctrine, Willis Whitfield the
Baptist doctrine, McCreary Bone the Presbyterian
and Bushrod Henry (the father of our present
J. O. Henry) preached the Christian doctrine—all
of them good, zealous Christian men. We
loved them all. At that day a boy would not
have been allowed to speak with disrespect of a
preacher at all, it would have been considered
almost like blasphemy to thus speak of a preacher
with disrespect.</p>

meadows, we could go out in the prairie
and on the low land we could cut from
three to four tons of good hay per acre.
A big boy could cut five tons per day, which
would now be worth at least fifty dollars. When
we was a boy, we went out to mow some hay,
and we found our good neighbor John Hall out
there mowing, and he showed us where to mow,
where the grass was very good, and he said there
was all the grass in that place we would both
cut. When it was near noon and pretty hot,
we were wanting water very much John called
us to come to him, we went, and he brought out
a very large, long watermelon from under some
green hay beneath his wagon, and we got in the
shade of his wagon. I do not think I have ever
enjoyed a melon with more relish than I did
that one.</p>

reptile with all its feet placed close together, thus
cutting it to pieces with its sharp hoofs.</p>

<p>It was, maybe, in the winter of 1844, it had
been very cold for a long time, my elder brother
would go to the spring for water every evening
near sunset, and there was a large buck drinking
in the spring, as the water was frozen up other
places; my Father said “wait and I will see if I
can kill him,” and he loaded up his big rifle
and went down to the big locust tree South of
the house, in plain view of the spring, and we
saw him draw up against the tree and take aim,
and “bang” went the rifle, and he ran to the
spring, directly we heard him hollering, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
two big boys ran with all their might; the bullet
had struck him on the horn, just where it joined
his head, and stunned him, and he lay there
until my Father caught him by the hind leg,
when he sprang to his feet; there was a solid
sheet of smooth ice, about fifteen feet across, and
the deer could not hold very good on the ice;
my Father said he had him down a dozen times,
but could not keep him down; he got his front
feet to the dry land once or twice, and my Father
would jerk him back, but when my brothers got
there they got hold of his horns and threw him
down and they all piled on him and held him
down until they cut his throat. My Father was
a large, stout man, and he said that was the
hardest scuffle he ever had. Such was pioneer
life in Illinois.</p>

drink, a picayune a drink. The men did not

When Ben got home, on the Saturday after, the

now Ben thought he would have a big day. The
men had their jugs hid in the bushes, and soon
one of my uncle’s and Bill Doyle got into a fight,
just out under some trees, then while Ben’s
attention was diverted, the men run in at the
back door and filled up their jugs, also one for
each of the combatants, and when the last jug
was full some one hollered: “Part ’em.” They
did not hardly leave Ben whiskey enough to
“drown his trouble.”</p>

time there was to be a spelling contest
between our school and one five miles East and
we was bothered to decide how to get the girls
there; but a day or two before the time for the
spelling, there came a deep snow, and then we
knew what to do; we had a very large yoke of
oxen, we would hitch them to the big sled and
we would have room for all, and when the day
came, soon afternoon, we hitched up and started
around to gather up our load of boys and girls,
and when we got them crowded closely into the
sled, we found we had room for all only two, but
we knew how to manage that, and I got on the
back of old Pete, while cousin Frank got on old
Mike and we struck out; but before we got there
we had a long hill to go down, and on one side
there was a pretty deep ditch washed out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
when we started down the hill the steers got to
going faster and faster, and when we saw that
we were running into that ditch, we hollered
“hoa”, and the steers stopped very suddenly,
while we “scooted” over their heads into the
deep snow; we jumped up as quick as we could,
and looked back, the sled was standing up on
one side, while the boys and girls were piled up
in that ditch three feet deep, but there was no
one hurt much, and we brushed the snow off,
and got there just at dark. Our boys and girls
kept laughing so, that we found it necessary to
ask leave to get up and explain what they were
laughing about. I told it as funny as I could,
and I was in practice then for telling things
funny; I also tried to show how old Pete was
standing, when I looked around, but I did not
have legs enough to show it just right; when I
got through, it took a long time to restore order.
When we had spelled for a long time and all
were “spelled down” on both sides, except our
brother Albert on our side and Manda Johnson
on their side, and when they had spelled for two
hours, and neither one had missed a word, the
judges decided to call it a “draw” and dismissed.</p>

eight dollars a head. One spring, when I was
a small boy, he sold to Wilson Perryman, his
cousin, eight cows and calves for eight dollars
each—sixty-four dollars for all. He got that all
in silver half-dollars, and put it in an old tin
bucket and sat it up on the cupboard, and the
same year, about September, he sold to John
Selby one hundred head of hogs for one hundred
dollars, all in silver, and he put it in the same
bucket, and when the neighbor’s children would
come over, we would get it down and pour it out
on the floor, to show them how much money we
had. Finally John Hodson borrowed it and
entered three forties of land, where New Hope

They would go into the lakes and gather
the rushes and pile them up very much like a
large shock of hay, so that it would come above
the water, then they would make a little flat
place on top and deposit two eggs on that flat
place; the eggs was a little larger than a goose
egg, while they were shaped just like a quail’s
egg, they were white in color with small brown
specks all over them. When we could get a
hat full of prairie hen’s eggs, and we believe no
better flavored egg can be found, when they
were boiled, then with a dish of fresh butter, a

<p>Love rocks the cradle of virtue, and brings
peace to the nations.</p>

<p>Love tunes the song of the lark, and paints
the rose.</p>

<p>Love indites the prayer, and speeds the answer.</p>

<p>Love tempers the storm and hallows the calm.</p>

<p>Love smiles in every swelling bud, and whispers
in every passing breeze.</p>

<p>Love softens the pillow and sweetens the dream.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Human family is restless and discontented;
constantly in quest of
something, and know not what that
something is. There is an aching
void in the mind, which men are constantly
seeking to satisfy, and very many remedies have
been tried and failed. Some have tried great
wealth and it has failed; some have tried great
learning, and it has failed; some have tried
fame, and it has failed; some have resorted to
strong drink, and it has failed; also, many other
things have been tried to satisfy that void and
failed. Man is out of his element, consequently
unhappy. Take a fish out of the water and it
will perish and die, because it is out of its element.
Man was created for peace and harmony
with his God. When he had violated the law
and was put out of the Garden, he lost his element;
hence this restless, unhappy condition.
Now, he may be represented as being blind—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
utter darkness, in quest of something and knows
not what it is. But God, in His Great Mercy,
has put a remedy within our reach; an efficient
antidote is prepared and brought to your door,
and not only so, but It knocks and asks admission;
It comes in the person of a gentle, loving
Spirit, whispering in accents of pity: “Oh! come
to me, and find rest”; ever, ever calling, calling:
“Believe, on me, and find peace.” That dear
Holy Ghost comes to your pillow at night. “Oh!
trust in Me and I will restore you to your proper
element; believe in Me and I will drive away all
this restless discontent”. Our fathers and mothers,
in their day, heard and obeyed this same
loving call, and found peace, by being placed in
their native element—peace with God.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Human family owe allegiance to
three great powers—their God, their
Country, and their Home; and the
three are so inseparably connected
that a person can hardly be true to one without
being true to all; there is a connecting link that
binds them together. We owe our allegance to
God because He is the author of our existence,
and gives us all the untold blessings that we
enjoy, and to Him we look for the hope of a
blessed immortality beyond this life, and by Him
we enjoy the blessings of our Country and our
Home. We owe allegiance to our Country because
by it we enjoy protection in our life and
property; it guarantees to us the right to worship
God according to the dictates of our own conscience,
and be protected in our Home. And to
the Home. Oh! how shall we begin the Home?
The most sacred place on earth, around whose
hearthstone the foundation is laid for the weal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>

not a power of all earthly powers; the Home is
the nucleus, the Alpha and Omega, the biggest,
biggest word pertaining to earthly things, spelled
with four letters, the hand is too feeble to write,
and the tongue is too feeble to tell, and the brain
is too feeble to conceive all the meaning there is
in that short word—Home. With its joys and
its sorrows, its toils and repose, its smiles and
its tears, its births and its deaths, its cradle and
its altar, its Bible and its pillow, its bitter and
its sweet, its precepts and its examples. When
orators and poets undertake to tell all the meaning
of that short word, let them pause and think,
and think, and think; and when it shall have
been declared that Time shall be no more; and
when the last trumpet shall have sounded and
when Angels shall have tuned their harps anew
and shall have struck up the ever new glad song
of redemption, through the Blood; and when the
pearly gates shall have been thrown wide open,
to welcome the redeemed and blood-washed
throng from earth: Oh! then, Home, Home.
Home forever-more.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">DEEP In the heart of every individual
is an inclination to be good and to do
good, but sometimes that good desire
is so counteracted by some evil influence,
that the poor individual unfortunately
drifts into ruin. The doctrine of total depravity
is all a mistake. The poor criminal often becomes
so by the influences which are brought to
bear upon his mind; and the good people are
often, more or less, responsible for his ruin, for
their indifference and lack of diligence in trying
to win him back to the path of honesty and
justice. The people who are good need not take
the praise to themselves, for they do not know
what they would have done under certain other
environments and influences; and often the poor
criminal is more to be pitied than blamed; often
in an unguarded moment he does things which
he had no thought of doing, and he would then
give his life to call it back. And when our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
neighbor goes to the bad, let us, instead of
exulting over his fall, rather shed a tear for him,
and think, maybe, I have not done my duty to
save him. But, fortunately, in our country, the
good is so much greater than the bad, and the
good influence so prevails over the bad, that
God still deals with us in mercy, and sends the
seedtime and harvest, and our people are a
prosperous and happy people.</p>

nearer threatening the overthrow of

The disregard for law is the result of

sharks have been very diligent in agitating all
the party prejudice they can, for they know that
if the voters lay down their love for party name,
they will work and vote together intelligently to
overthrow the great wrongs, and there will be a
leveling up, and that class legislation will have
to go, and the liquor traffic will have to go, and
equal rights will prevail. The people are intelligent
enough to know their wrongs, but they
are so completely bound hand and foot by their
party name, that they cannot help themselves.
They know that the issues, which the leaders of
the parties, have kept the voters divided upon
for many years, was only “sham” issues, and
not the real issues at all. The voters of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
country are intelligent on every other question,
but almost hopelessly insane on the question of
party. There is no question now for which lecturers
are needed so much. If you kill the foolish
blind party prejudice, the same stroke will kill
every public wrong which exists in our land.
We think we have some pretty good reasons to
hope that the great wrongs will be righted within
a few years; but there are no good reasons why
they should not be righted within a few months.</p>

strength of the Nation is derived from the homes;
and if the homes are good, the Nation is good.
If the homes are bad, the Nation is bad. It is
hard for the homes to be right good without the

early settlers to love one another, and
we love to think of the many noble men
and women who made great sacrifices
for, their fellow-man; but none could ever come
up with Jasper L. Douthit. Having been brought
to Illinois, by his parents, when a very small
boy, one of the first things he seemed to learn
was self-sacrifice for others. He caught the
Spirit of Love to others, and outstripped any man
in Illinois. No man in Illinois has made such
self-sacrifice for others as Jasper L. Douthit.
He has given his whole life for others. He is a
Unitarian preacher, and he is not only Unitarian
in name, but if people serve the God whom his
mother taught him to serve, whether Methodist
or Baptist, or any other denomination, he loves
them just the same. So he is a real Unitarian.
When he has been persecuted by the people, who
did not understand him, he worked on, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
actions said: “Father forgive them, they know
not what they do”; and his great big heart overflowing
with love, he sought to do them good.
Few men have had better opportunities to know
him than we have; and Jasper is as able to cope
with the intricate problems of statesmanship as
almost any man in the land, and yet simple as a
child. If he sees you in trouble, his eyes will
fill with tears. Now, in his old age, he is the
hardest working man we ever knew. He is no
lover of money, and when he makes money it
just goes, with the overflowing of his heart, for
the good of others.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE BELIEVE there is no wrong in our
good country so potent in perpetuating
evil, as the party prejudice of the
voters. The prejudice for political
party is what makes possible every great wrong
which exists in our land. The voters would vote
together, intelligently, to correct every wrong
were it not for their prejudice for their party.
When one political party takes a stand for a good
thing, the other party makes it their business to
oppose them. The corruption which existed in
the state of Missouri, never could have existed
only for the party prejudice. The disregard for
law, which has given the President so much
trouble, and cost so much money, would have
been nipped in the bud, only for the party prejudice.
The American voter is intelligent on
every other subject, but on the subject of political
party, he is deplorably insane. They do not
vote so much for men and principle, but are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
blindly governed by party name. You kill the
foolish blind party prejudice and the same stroke
kills every great political wrong in our land.
Each party will go down into the dirt to court
the friendship of every low, dirty element who
has a vote. Kill the party prejudice and lawlessness
and anarchy will have to hide their
deformed faces. When it is found that a man is
not willing to obey the laws of this good country
a committee should wait upon him and tell him
that the sooner he packs his trunks the better.
We have a class of rich, aristocratic anarchists
who want to run this Government; then we have
a class of low, ignorant and dirty anarchists at
the tail end, and the country would be better off
without either. The American people are a
country loving people, and they want to do right
and vote right; but their love of party has such
complete control over them that they cannot
always do right; but they must say and do what
their party leaders say for them to do. The party
leaders give us issues to contend over and keep
us divided, which we know are not the issues.
So the love for political party is the mother of
every great public wrong which exists, and it is
the only thing which makes possible every public
wrong.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WE BELIEVE there is no evil in our
land so great as the use of intoxicating
liquors. No evil is causing so
much sorrow, so many tears, blighting
so many bright hopes and sunny prospects,
breaking up so many happy homes. We punish
the robber by the law, and no robber can compare
with the Robber Intemperance. He robs
the home of its sanctity and its joys; it robs the
brain of its power and its intelligence; it robs
the heart of its love and its emotions; it robs the
man of his manliness and reduces him to a level
with the brute; it robs youth of its hopes and its
prospects; it robs childhood of everything which
makes for comfort and happiness. We furnish
the murder by law. No murderer is so cold-blooded
as is intemperance. It murders one
hundred thousand American citizens annually.
If an epidemic were to break out, like smallpox,
cholera, or yellow fever, which was destroying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
half as many lives our authorities would quarantine
against it very quickly, and would spend
millions of dollars, if need be, to stop the devastation,
while that which intemperance is making
no great notice is taken, for if we do, we will
hurt our party, for the whisky element will vote
with the other party. Now, gentle reader, isn’t
it better to stand for the right, for God and the
home, and for the country? even at the risk of
being defeated in the election, than to stand for
wrong in order to carry the election. Think of
gray heads going to their graves in sorrow, because
intemperance has ruined their children,
and your vote helped to cause that ruin. Think
of the men who are now in the various state
prisons, and your vote helped to put them there.
Think of the oceans of tears that wives and
mothers have shed, and your vote helped to
cause those tears. Think of the hunger and cold
that little innocent children have suffered, and
your vote helped to cause that suffering. Look
at that little innocent boy and think that maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that little boy will fill a drunkard’s grave, and
my vote will help to cause it so, because of my
love for my beloved party. Look at the little
innocent girl, and think maybe, that little girl
is to be the wife of a drunkard, and that my vote
helped to cause it so, for the sake of my party.
Dear reader, let me appeal to you: Why should
we rate political party above every other consideration?
Oh! the cruel monster, intemperance.
No pen can ever write the enormity of his crimes.
No orator’s tongue can ever tell the magnitude
of his guilt. Like a vile serpent, he tightens his
slimy coils around everything that is noble and
good, of American institutions and American
manhood. No place on earth is too sacred for
his poisonous fangs. No hopes or prospects are
too bright for his blighting and withering influence.
Oh! let us arise in our manhood and bury
him so deep that there will be no possibility of
his resurrection. How I would like to be one of
the pall-bearers and help to bear him to his last
resting place. Then a shout of joy would go up;
a shout such as was never heard on the earth.
A shout from the throats of millions of wronged
and oppressed mothers and children. A shout
of “peace on earth, good will to men!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Author of this little book has had
a pretty happy life. We have had
the same difficulties to contend with
that other people have had, but we
knew the bright side of things was the best side
to look at, and we believe we have been able to
see a brighter side to most things than most of
the people have. Most everything that comes
in our road has a bright side to it, if we are only
able to see that bright side. If we are seeking
to do right, that fact, of itself, turns the dark
side of the picture to the wall, and beautiful
fields, singing birds, and blooming flowers are
ours. If the readers of our little book would
only cast off their unnecessary gloom and forebodings,
the world would be brighter and happier
and the people would be healthier and happier,
and they would live a great deal longer.</p>
